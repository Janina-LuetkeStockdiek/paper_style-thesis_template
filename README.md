# LaTeX Template for the research group Computational Social Science & Systems Analysis 

Welcome! This template was developed for the research group Computational Social Science & Systems Analysis. It basically follows all LaTeX-conventions. If you have any (severe) problems, suggestions or ideas how to improve this template, feel free to contact the author, since this template is a work in progress. 

The template consists of a `main.tex`-file in which all relevant parts are defined. In the __code__ folder, you can include files of algorithms etc. which are part of the thesis. In the __content__ folder, you can include all relevant chapters as single `.tex`-files. In the __figures__ folder - as the name already suggests - you can include images, graphics etc. Please do not edit the __settings__ folder. If you have any problems with the template, send the author an e-mail. If you want to include any packages which are not part of this template, you can do so in the preamble of `main.tex`.
