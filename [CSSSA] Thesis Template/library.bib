abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

abstract = {From the Publisher:Intelligent Agents - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig show how intelligent agents can be built using AI methods, and explain how different agent designs are appropriate depending on the nature of the task and environment. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach is the first AI text to present a unified, coherent picture of the field. The authors focus on the topics and techniques that are most promising for building and analyzing current and future intelligent systems. The material is comprehensive and authoritative, yet cohesive and readable. State of the Art - This book covers the most effective modern techniques for solving real problems, including simulated annealing, memory-bounded search, global ontologies, dynamic belief networks, neural networks, adaptive probabilistic networks, inductive logic programming, computational learning theory, and reinforcement learning. Leading edge AI techniques are integrated into intelligent agent designs, using examples and exercises to lead students from simple, reactive agents to advanced planning agents with natural language capabilities.}

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to ½ everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},
